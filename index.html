      <p>
        My name is Matthew. I'm as an Associate Systems Administrator where I
        provide daily end-user support for several locations. I also support
        and maintain our Anit-Virus, Anti-Malware, Spam Filter, and eFax systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been in the IT field for over 20 years. I got starting in IT by
        doing in-home Support and Tutoring while attending College. Shortly
        after completing the MCSE Certification in 2000, I was offered a temporary
        position helping to deploy PCs. This quickly
        turned into a full-time position, starting my Profession Career.

        <h3>Systems Support and Administration</h3>
        <p>
          Over the years I have picked up a number of skills covering End-user
          support to server administration. I have honed my Troubleshooting and
          Problem-Solving skills, to help me excel in Technical Support. I'm a
          people person, which allows me to comfortably speak with all levels
          of users and communicate technical concepts to non-technical
          individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have worked with Desktops, Laptops, Servers, Remote Administration.
          Hardware and software support. Detecting and cleaning up Viruses,
          Malware and other nasty stuff we don't want on our machines.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also used scripting and programming languages to assist me in
          both large and small projects.

        <h3>Programmer</h3>
        <p>
          I've always been interested in programming. I've successfully used
          batch scripts, VB Scripts, and Powershell to help make things easier
          or feel in a need someplace. However, I've been drawn to learn more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I'm enjoying getting more into programming with Python. It
          has been a fun journey and I hope to use what I have been learning to 
          help solve issues at work and maybe some freelancing here and there.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can find me on
          <a href="https://py.checkio.org/user/ithink2020/">CheckIO</a>
          and
          <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/ithink2020">Codewars</a>.
          I've found these sites to be a really great way to dive deeper into
          learning Python as well getting practice coding on a regular basis,
          while I aspire to become a better programmer.

      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
      <div class="hobbies-row">
        <h3>Family</h3>
        <img class="family" src="images/family.png" alt="coding-img">
        <p>
          The thing I enjoy most is spending time with family and going on
          little adventures. It could be as simple as a walk around the
          neighborhood or a weeklong vacation.
        </p>
        <h3>Wine</h3>
        <img class="wine" src="images/wine.png" alt="coding-img">
        <p>
          I also like making my own wine. I've made wine from kits, fruits, and
          fresh local grapes. It's satisfying relaxing with a glass of wine in
          hand, that came from the fruits of your own labor.
        </p>
        <h3>Guitar</h3>
        <img class="guitar" src="images/electric-guitar.png" alt="coding-img">
        <p>
          I've always wanted to learn to play. Although it has been a challenge,
          it has been fun. I highly recommend
